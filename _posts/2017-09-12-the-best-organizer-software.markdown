For this project, we redesigned the Worcester Public Library website for a mobile phone while also directing the design towards a certain demographic. We were tasked to design our website for churches/religious organizations. As a result, we aimed to create a website that emphasized being involved in the library community, which was an aspect that religion-centric libraries that we looked at focused on, while still maintaining a sleek and intuitive user experience.

We first looked at the websites of several private and parish libraries and noticed how was easy it was to see that they were affiliated with the church since their front pages usually involved crosses and Bible quotes. However, we were supposed to be designing a website for a public library, which like public schools cannot openly display affiliation with one religion over another, so we ruled out using such obvious religious imagery.

While we opted against adding the blatant use of religious imagery to our library website design, we did take inspiration from the colors and the layouts of the websites we studied. The color schemes varied depending on the organization, but the use of tan, yellow, and gold were very common throughout. We also included purple in our color scheme because it is a complimentary color and this assignment fell close to Easter, symbolized by purple in the Catholic church. The colors received mixed reviews; they might have gone over better if we had made them not as bright, kept the scheme more consistent, or used them as accents against a white background on some of the linked pages rather than as a fill color for the whole screen.

We found that many of the websites hosted by churches and religious groups heavily emphasize getting involved with the community, and use some level of off-line communication, so we decided to feature a way to sign up for a newsletter on the main page. To increase the number of images and direct people’s attention to particular pages, we also included a “news feed” of pictures that can link to particular events or web pages.

For the design of the other pages, we wanted to keep the formatting similar to the main page when possible. We also wanted to make it easy and provide multiple options to navigate back to the main page, and between the various sub-pages. Many of the church websites we looked at had fairly minimalist designs, and churches include members of all ages, some of whom may not be completely comfortable on computers, and we tried to accommodate them as much as possible by taking this approach. Providing multiple navigation options and an ever-present home button makes it harder to get lost on a webpage.

We moved our navigation menu to the bottom of the main page because we already had several fields in the header, including practical-use options like a the library catalog search and and the library logo to be used as a home button. In our navigation menu, we only included the pages that were actively linked to another screen, but a larger menu with unlinked options might have been a better choice for showing the usability of the final webpage.

On the main page, it made sense to have the navigation menu as a drop-down list on the main page, because it required minimal scrolling, and only past the things we were trying to direct people to look at first anyway. In retrospect, on other pages that involved more scrolling, the navigation menu should have been moved to the top of the page.

Several people also commented that the arrow for the drop-down menu pointed down but appeared above the menu, which was also the result of time constraints — all of the screens had already been uploaded with a certain size, and since it’s common for drop-down menus to cover a small amount of content when selected, we decided it wasn’t important to resize them all.

The minor issue with the menu appearing above instead of below the drop-down tab, and many other issues might have been possible to iron out if we had started fabricating the graphics sooner. We researched Monday and finalized design sketches Tuesday and Wednesday, but underestimated the amount of time it would take to generate the mock up screens and coordinate last minute details before Friday afternoon.

The creation of the website design was especially difficult because we were working on different graphics editing programs depending on what each group member had available at the time — some of the work was done in Vectr, some of it was done in Photoshop, which meant that layers weren’t preserved for easy editing. For example, we had discussed wanting to use a serif font for the app, but ended up using Arial because that was what the first complete-looking screen design was uploaded in.

Overall, I think we had a fairly good design plan, but some issues related to execution that our classmates noticed when they tested our example. If we had more time, we would spend it on cleaning our visual design and navigation, and including additional information and links that were cut from the demo. I do feel that most of the changes we would want to make at this point are relatively minor aesthetic changes, that would be easy to fix if this project had a second iteration, which means that our design is functional if slightly incomplete.
