When I first signed up for Human-Computer Interactions, I thought it would be a typical Computer Science class like the others I had taken in the past, but I was delightfully surprised. As a computer science, I have rarely delved into the design aspect of the major but have mainly been focusing on the coding, mathematics, and theory components. Taking this class has been a breath of fresh air as I explored what goes into the design process and experiment with the series of unique and educational projects presented to us throughout the course. While I have had my fair share of ups and down throughout the term, I believe that I will come away as a more informed designer and with a whole new skillset to apply to my future endeavors. 
  
###  Keeping an Eye on the Target
During the beginning of the course, I had had some experience with design in art classes I had taken in middle school but, for the most part, I had no idea what the design process was. After finishing the first couple of introductory readings, I gained a general conceptual sense of what the design process meant, but it was not until the first project that I achieved a deeper understanding of the process. The first project, where we went around campus and looked at good and bad designs, opened my eyes to facets of campus I had paid no mind to before.

My first group project, Design for Others, helped initially shape my own design process as we all took a stab implementing the concepts we read about into an actual product – in this case, a website. I developed a couple methods that would become defining steps in my own design process, such as the importance of brainstorming and moving on with ideas based on constraints and the needs of the buyer/target audience. When thinking of design choices for our website, which was centered around religious groups, we wrote down our ideas on our own individual sheets of paper. When we had culminated enough ideas, we shared our designs and ended up taking up the best bits and pieces for each to combine into our website. When narrowing down our choices, we always had our target audience first in our minds, being the driving force behind many of our design decisions, such as the color pallet.

###  Teamwork Makes the Dream Work
As we progressed in the course, we moved on to more challenging projects, such as Design for Understanding, Design for Tension, and Design for Wellbeing. For such projects, the development of the product was much more challenging and learning the tools and relevant skills became a much larger obstacle to traverse. For Design for Wellbeing especially, technical limitations and time became defining constraints that limited what we ultimately ended up producing for our final project. Accordingly, I learned that teamwork, such as taking responsibility for your section of the project and divvying up work fairly, and clear communication were vital to group success and are skills that should be applied to the design process when working in groups. Groups varied greatly from project to project and, while the skills, personalities, and contributions varied, those couple methods that I used for designing kept everyone on track and eventually led to a good final output. For example, for the Design for Understanding, we brainstormed a ton of ideas and divided them up amongst ourselves to design individually. Fortunately, most us were able to work on our own generated idea due to the amount of visualizations that needed to be made. Having each person work on their own design also allowed them to put their own passion and creativity into it, which led to some cool innovations later in the design process. We communicated frequently via Slack and helped each other out when needed. While each group member had varying experience with JavaScript, we all managed to work together well and combine our own visions in our final iteration.
	
###  Sticking to the Plan
Lastly, another point that I incorporated into my design process was sticking to the instructions. I believe that it is extremely important for groups to stay on task and focus on the fact that form shouldn’t overshadow the originally-intended function. When working on the Design for Tension project, we specifically encountered issues with tying the project back to the original prompt. My team built a chatbot that tried to convince the user to like cats if they were originally a dog person and vice versa. While it was a fun idea, I believe that we got somewhat carried away and strayed a little far from the original purpose, which led to a final product that was a little too broad and underdeveloped. The chatbot had a lot of somewhat confusing trees with very little substance and ended up corning the user into choosing choices that they might not be fully committed to. When I was working on projects from then on, I made sure that we, as a group, established a clear goal/purpose and made sure that we stuck to it throughout the design process, which led to much more solid results like an Emotional YouTube Manipulator in Design for Wellbeing and an immersive underwater scene for Design for Another World.
	
###  Reflection	
Looking back over all the work I’ve done, I realize that I have gained quite the repertoire of knowledge through studying the design process, working with groups, and taking part in so many different project topics. Through such experiences, I’ve constructed a design process of my own, which includes: brainstorming, keeping the needs of the buyer/target audience in mind, teamwork, communicating clearly, and keeping on task. While I did not learn a new programming language, an efficient search algorithm, or an insightful mathematical concept, like one does in a typical computer science course, I gain a whole new set of skills that will not only help me in my major but can be applied to the world around me every day.
