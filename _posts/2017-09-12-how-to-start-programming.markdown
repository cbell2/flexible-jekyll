Nobody at WPI looks forward to winter. Whether it be the bone-chilling bursts of wind or the metric tons of snow that make walking across the Quad feel like you’re trekking through Hoth, winter is not welcomed with open arms. However, while snow drifts and black ice have laid siege to the campus, WPI students have become inconvenienced by a problem rooted in poor design choices that they might’ve not seen forming right in front of their eyes: icicles.

###  Overhanging Issues
While such roofing design, especially overhangs like the ones pictured, don’t initially evoke a sense of “bad design,” it has been an annoying problem for those traversing around campus. As the weather got colder and colder, these overhangs led to the formation of a plethora of icicles to the extent that the associated walkways were blocked in case any fell, barring off certain building entryways and sections of campus. Even though this outcome is not one of immediate concern, I believe that it is a design that could be improved upon lest the students suffer congested doorways or, lest I say, tardiness.

###  Function
Walkways and overhangs are mainly centered around their functionality as their purpose is to provide a safe, efficient, and organized route from building to building. Normally, traditional New England roofs like the ones present at WPI tend to accomplish their purpose fairly well. However, ironically, due to location of the walkway relative to the drop-off of the roof, the overhang leads to unsafe conditions since not only icicles can form, but precipitation can land right on the sidewalk and even converge at the edge of the entryways as pictured above, resulting int a refreshing splash of runoff as you enter Atwater Kent for example. For professors and students, the primary users of such overhangs and walkways around campus, such unfortunate incidents could spell certain death if water were to drench their ever-important notes, lesson plans, or other crucial paperwork.

###  Form
Compared to the importance on functionality, the form of the overhangs takes a backseat. While I will give WPI some credit since work did go into designing the overhang to make it fit in with the other traditional WPI architecture via woodwork and painting, nature has clearly taken its toll on the structure as chipping and other forms of degradation can be seen. Going along with function, possibly taking advantage of different types of materials to better protect individuals walking along the paths that are more resistant to weathering and ice accumulation could result in an aesthetically-superior design as well.

As young students without an experienced eye for design, we don’t tend to appreciate the thoughtfulness that goes into the designs that make our lives a lot easier. What college student would go a week without their phone or even a day without the assistance or an alarm to get them moving or a hot cup of joe to energize them? Who knows, sometimes the smallest change in a design could be the difference between a good day and showing up to class completely drenched.
