Imagine that you’re in the shoes of a WPI student. You walk into your first lecture of the day, spot your friends, take your seat in the lecture hall, and wipe away the sleep from your eyes that you find after waking up at the inhuman hour of 11am. If asked where you might find a design that would exemplify beauty in both form and function, where would you look? Maybe you’d pick any one of the technological gizmos the professor is using to teach their lesson or maybe you’d look to your seat or its movable desk, but I doubt you’d look up.

###  Why Choose Lights?
I chose the lights overhanging the lecture halls for my example of a well-designed object. Lights, as far as purpose goes, are very straightforward; they are used to provide lighting to an area. However, especially within the context of a lecture hall, the designers had to make modifications to the fundamental design of the hanging light that we, as students, take for granted. The most significant modification in my opinion is that these lights provide indirect lighting rather than direct lighting. As a result, there is no glare on the professor’s screen, the students aren’t exposed to harsh light, and the light is able to be easily diffused via the ceiling which can illuminate the room more entirely.

###  Function
While lights are a basic and familiar occurrence, concerning ourselves with the users of these lights provides us with some input in order to judge their functionality. The overhead lights are used by the professors teaching in the lecture halls and they are indirectly used by the students who come to learn there. After looking over the room and having taken several classes personally in Fuller Upper, I would say that these lights accomplish their purpose in that they are able to light up the room, blackboard, and screen appropriately while not giving the students eye-strain. While not as significant, the design also allows for clean cable management and sturdy supports.

###  Form
Unlike more traditional fixtures, lights, especially ones such as these, are not commonly critiqued from a beauty standpoint. In my opinion the geometric shapes that make up the cover give the structure an aesthetically pleasing form, but I could see how it could make the overall design of the light bland to some. However, going along with it’s non-intrusive function, I would call this blandness a plus since it would not distract students during lectures.

While you might not notice, lots of thought and work goes into the design of every little thing you encounter in your daily life. From the chair you sit in to the lights that buzz above you, the modern day world is one designed around us. As we keep on learning more and more about the effort that goes into design, hopefully it will open our eyes to all the behind-the-scenes magic that goes into making an idea into a reality.
